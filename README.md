# JavaChat
Simple Java chat without GUI (yet). It can work both on Socket and Selector. Supports multiple clients.   

This project was made for educational purposes only. 

Switching between Selector and Socket handling is located in loader/config.properties file. 

Right now Selector is not properly working,but soon its gonna be perfect.
